Project Guideline

Each group will have Minimum 3 members or Maximum 4 members.

Each Member will implement a total of 4 features. Each member has to demonstrate his/her

1st feature in module 1

2nd feature in module 2 and

3rd and 4th feature in module 3

Project features will be evaluated in 3 modules: lab 5 (Module 1), lab 6 (Module 2) and lab 7 (Module 3). If any group member is absent/unable to demonstrate his/her feature(s) - he/she will get zero marks on that particular feature.

Login+Signup+Logout should be considered as 1 feature

Each member must complete at least one external API integration to the system as a feature. For example: Single Sign-On (SSO) / OAuth Login, SMS Notifications, Push Notifications, Online Payments, Google Maps API, Google Directions API, Google Vision, Google Calendar API, Facebook Graph API, OpenAI, Google NLP, HuggingFace, etc.

All web/desktop/android frameworks are allowed except CMS (WordPress, Drupal, Joomla, Wix, Squarespace, and Shopify), core PHP and Firebase, Django.

Students are permitted to use AI-assisted tools such as GPT, Claude, Gemini, GitHub Copilot, and similar platforms strictly for partial code generation and debugging support. However, please note the following:

AI dependency without understanding is strictly prohibited.

Failure to properly explain any AI-generated code when asked will result in zero marks.

Inability to perform live modifications (both frontend and backend) during evaluation will also lead to zero marks, regardless of overall project quality.

All students must ensure they maintain complete ownership and understanding of their codebase. AI may assist you but it cannot replace your logic, reasoning, or accountability.

UI/UX Requirement: You have to follow Basic front-end layout standards.

It must be Responsive and mobile-friendly.

Allowed: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, Material UI, DaisyUI, Chakra UI, Ant Design, or any CSS library/framework that is not a full CMS or page builder.

Not Allowed: Drag-and-drop builders like Elementor, Wix-style editors, or AI-generated full page templates without understanding the code structure.

Database Requirement: Must use SQL / NoSQL / Local Storage

Version Control Rule: Each team must use GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket with individual commit history. Copy-paste code without commits will be penalized.

Hardcode data is not accepted. CRUD operations must be real.
