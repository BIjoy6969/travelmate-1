Tech Stack:
Language: Javascript   
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB
Styling: TailwindCSS
Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) & Render/Heroku (Backend)
External APIs: Google Maps API, OpenWeather API, Flight API, Currency Conversion API



Functional requirements:
Module 1 – User & Destination Management
[Member-1] Users can register and log in securely to their account using JWT authentication.


Users can view their dashboard after logging in and see saved destinations.


(Uses Google Maps API for location autocomplete.)


[Member-2] Users can browse top destinations with images, ratings, and descriptions fetched from an external travel data API.


No login required to view this section.


(Uses Travel/TripAdvisor API.)


[Member-3] Search & Favorites (OpenStreetMap (OSM), Leaflet.js, Nominatim)
Global Search: Users can search for any city, country, or landmark in the world using a search bar.
Map Visualization: When a user selects a destination, the system displays its exact location on an interactive map (using OpenStreetMap).
Save to Favorites: Users can save destinations to a personal "Favorites" list for quick access later.
Manage Favorites: Users can view their saved list and remove destinations they are no longer interested in.


[Member-4] Users can view real-time weather details of any destination.


(Uses OpenWeather API.)



Module 2 – Trip & Budget Planning
[Member-1] Users can create a trip plan by selecting destinations, travel dates, and trip type (solo, family, etc.).


Saved trips can be edited or deleted later.


[Member-2] Users can generate a day-by-day itinerary using an AI-based recommendation system.


(Uses a Travel Suggestion API or Gemini API for AI suggestions.)


[Member-3] AI Budget Estimator
Trip Setup: Users can select a destination (module 1, member 3), enter travel dates, and choose a travel style (e.g., Budget, Standard, Luxury).
AI Cost Calculation: The system uses the Gemini AI API to calculate the estimated total cost of the trip. So, basically, the gemini api is used to do 2 things. (1) Generate a list of popular things to do (based on their travel style). (2) Generate the cost for them.
Cost Breakdown: The system displays a categorized breakdown of estimated expenses (e.g., Food, Hotel, Transport).
Manual Adjustment: Users can view the AI's estimates and manually add or edit costs if they want to customize the budget.


[Member-4] Users can check live currency conversion rates for their chosen destination.


(Uses Currency Exchange API.)



Module 3 – Flight, Hotel & Support Services
[Member-1] Users can search and compare available flights between two locations by date and price.


(Uses Flight API.)


[Member-1] Users can book a preferred flight and store booking info in their dashboard.


[Member-2] Users can view and book hotels with details like location, price, and amenities.


(Uses Hotel Booking API.)


[Member-2] Users can view hotel booking history and cancel existing bookings.


[Member-3] Users can chat with an AI-based virtual assistant for travel tips or support queries. Integrate this guy elegantly with the rest of the website.


(Uses Gemini API. This has already been set up).


[Member-3] Users can rate and review destinations to share their experiences. 


[Member-4] A personalized dashboard displays trip summaries, weather info, flight data, and total spending insights.


[Member-4] Users can export trip details and budgets as a downloadable PDF report.




🚀 1. Deployment Overview
You’ll deploy the MERN stack project in 3 connected layers:
Layer
Tech
Deployment Platform
Notes
Frontend (React)
React + Tailwind
Vercel or Netlify
Easiest for hosting React apps
Backend (Express + Node)
Node.js + Express
Render, Railway, or Vercel Serverless Functions
Deploy as API endpoints
Database (MongoDB)
MongoDB Atlas
Free Cloud Cluster
Cloud-hosted database
External APIs
Google Maps, Weather, Flight, Currency, etc.
Integrated in backend/frontend
Add API keys in .env file

🔧 Steps to Deploy
Step 1: Set up MongoDB Atlas
Create an account on https://www.mongodb.com/atlas


Create a new project → cluster


Add a database user and get your connection URI
 Example:

 mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.mongodb.net/travelmate


Step 2: Prepare the Backend (Express)
Add all environment variables (.env):

 MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB URI>
WEATHER_API_KEY=<Your API Key>
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=<Your API Key>
FLIGHT_API_KEY=<Your API Key>
CURRENCY_API_KEY=<Your API Key>


Test locally:

 npm run server


Deploy backend to Render or Railway:


Push backend code to GitHub


Connect repo to Render → select Node.js environment


Deploy → get public API URL, e.g.,

 https://travelmate-api.onrender.com


Step 3: Prepare the Frontend (React)
Set your backend base URL in React:

 const BASE_URL = "https://travelmate-api.onrender.com";


Build:

 npm run build


Deploy to Vercel or Netlify (link to your GitHub repo).


Step 4: Connect Everything
Frontend → Backend (via REST API)


Backend → MongoDB Atlas


Backend/Frontend → External APIs



🌐 2. Website Workflow
Here’s the logical flow of the full project, showing how all 3 modules and 4 members’ features connect but stay independent.

🏠 Homepage
Shows welcome banners, top travel destinations, and a search bar (powered by Google Maps API).


Buttons:


“Explore Destinations”


“Create Trip Plan”


“Book Flights & Hotels”


“Login / Register”



🧍‍♂️ Module 1 – User & Destination Management
Goal: Manage user identity and explore destinations
 Pages/Flows:
Register/Login Page → Authenticates using JWT.


Explore Destinations → Fetches from external Travel API.


Destination Details → Shows map + weather data (via OpenWeather API).


Favorites Page → User adds/removes destinations.


➡️ Outcome: Each user can explore, favorite, and view weather — all APIs integrated here.

🧳 Module 2 – Trip & Budget Planning
Goal: Help users plan personalized trips and budgets
 Pages/Flows:
Create Trip Page: Select destination + dates + travel type


Saved to MongoDB.


AI Itinerary Page: Suggests daily plan (via Gemini/AI API).


Budget Tracker: Add expenses → Auto total and remaining budget.


Currency Conversion Widget: Converts rates live (Currency API).


➡️ Outcome: Full trip plan + budget visualization saved per user.

✈️ Module 3 – Flight, Hotel & Support
Goal: Provide travel booking & post-planning features
 Pages/Flows:
Flight Search: User inputs “From”, “To”, “Date” → Flight API returns results.


Flight Booking Page: Book + Save ticket info.


Hotel Booking Page: Browse and reserve rooms (Hotel API).


AI Assistant Chat: Get travel advice via chatbot.


Dashboard Page: Summarizes all trips, budgets, weather, and bookings.


Export PDF Button: Download trip report.


➡️ Outcome: All independent features merge into one dashboard view — showing complete system functionality.

🧩 3. How to Show All Functional Requirements Together (For Demo)
When you present or test the project:
Step
Action

Module 1 (Member 1–4)
2
Log in → create new trip → add budget → convert currency
Module 2 (Member 1–4)
3
Search for flight → book → open dashboard → view summary
Module 3 (Member 1–4)
4
Click “Export PDF” → generate downloadable report
Module 3 (FR 8)
5
Optional: Open console/logs to show external API data fetched

🎯 5. Final Tips for Deployment
Use CORS properly to allow frontend–backend communication.


Use dotenv for all secret API keys.


Test APIs using Postman before connecting the frontend.


In Vercel/Render → Add .env variables in dashboard settings.


Ensure both backend and frontend are online simultaneously.
